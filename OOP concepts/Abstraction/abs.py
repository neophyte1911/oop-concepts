'''

Abstraction hides the internal implementation details while exposing only the necessary functionality. It helps focus on "what to do" rather than "how to do it."
Types of Abstraction:

    Partial Abstraction: Abstract class contains both abstract and concrete methods.
    Full Abstraction: Abstract class contains only abstract methods (like interfaces).

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):  # Abstract Method

    def display_name(self):  # Concrete Method
        print(f"Dog's Name: {self.name}")

class Labrador(Dog):  # Partial Abstraction
    def sound(self):
        print("Labrador Woof!")

class Beagle(Dog):  # Partial Abstraction
    def sound(self):
        print("Beagle Bark!")

# Example Usage
dogs = [Labrador("Buddy"), Beagle("Charlie")]
for dog in dogs:
    dog.display_name()  # Calls concrete method
    dog.sound()  # Calls implemented abstract method
