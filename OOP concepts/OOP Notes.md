Object Oriented means directed towards objects. In other words, it means functionally directed towards modelling objects.


This is one of the many techniques used for modelling complex systems by describing a collection of interacting objects via their data and behavior.


Major pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are 
Inheritance, 
Polymorphism, 
Abstraction, and
Encapsulation.
